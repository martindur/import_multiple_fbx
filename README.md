# import_multiple_fbx

Info:
Works exactly as importing single fbx file, just with the support of selecting and importing multiple at a time.

New:
Added two import settings in regards to whether or not you want to import the global position/rotation of the fbx files. When importing multiple files, their position and rotation in global space can matter. E.g. if you are importing several trees and a terrain landscape. ATTENTION: The default settings are to reset position/rotation to keep to the defaults of the official importer.
